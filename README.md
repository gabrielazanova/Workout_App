> The application helps users customize their workout. 

The user has the option to add activities to the workout, indicating the duration. Moreover, activities can be deleted from the workout, using the "Edit" button. 
After the workout is started, the user cannot add or edit the activities until the workout is finished or reset. While the workout is in progress,
the user can pause it or directly stop it by reseting the timer. Furthermore, during the whole workout, the user knows which activity he/she should be doing, as 
well as the time left for the current activity and the time left for the workout.
